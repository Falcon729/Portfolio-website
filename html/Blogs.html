			<p>Technology and invention are two things in this world. They have played an amazing role for human, because of technology humans are now in a different era. Humans have upgraded their primitive life to modern life, they have overcome their primitive lifestyle and have started living a satisfying lifestyle. Technology is very close to us like the time when we wake up to the time we sleep, we use various gadgets and we are also surrounded by them. human life has become more convenient to live. It's all because of technology we have witnessed the beauty of nature and also are living luxurious lives.</p><br>
			<p>We know have been told about technology from our childhood and all those things do exist. For Example: before boys and girls were not able to communicate with each other but now they can chat with each other as well as with many other people. There are many webpages for online dating, storing data in clouds, automated cars. All of these things have become part of our life, which are products of technology and inventions done by specified peoples.</p>

			<p>Today's world has something to say that "if you are offered that means you need to pay for it". That means technology has made our life extremely luxurious but it has also made us crazy. People give their maximum time to technology and their products like mobile, laptop e.t.c and have been too lazy to do their own work.</p><br>
			<p>This picture shows a conversation between a boy and a man. This picture clearly shows that children use their mobiles every time. when they wake up or during their bedtime they need their mobile first. Because of technology, people have started shopping from their home but they are affecting their own life and wasting their precious time by just watching movies or playing games.</p>

			<p>I think this has some connection between humans and technology. It is because we humans have got many things from technology but now it's a technology whose taking our sleep, time and money. In return we humans are getting for new technology but don't have any idea about, how will it affect us?. </p><br>
			<p>Nowadays the use of gadgets that have increased a lot and the way human uses new technology in their daily life to ease their living has started affecting them in a negative way. When some countries have conflicts between them, they have started treating for nuclear war which is not good for the whole world. Because of some new machines, unemployment has increased in the world. The technology was meant to build human life luxurious but miserable.</p>

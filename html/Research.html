			<p>The idea was to keep the background as simple as it can be made. So, i found a websites named "h5games.online" which has a simple background and some words and images.</p><br>
			<p>Home page of my website is a little bit similar to h5games.online because i tried to keep home page simple. As a different feature navigation bar of my websites are transparent when the navigation are touched by the pointer.</p><br><br><br> <hr>
		</div>
		<div class="defcompone">
			<p>This page is about me where it has all details about the creator of this websites. For my cv i was looking into different websites and finally got idea through a websites named "MONSTER". This website is a job website from where, it helped me to place my image in a perfect place.</p><br>
			<p>The background of my website and monster are different. Monster website has less words but this page on my websites has more words then images because it's about the developer.</p><br><br><br>

		<div class="defcomptwo">
			<p>When i was trying to write blogs on technology, i searched for the educational websites and got udemy as a comparable website. Udemy itself is an educational website and my topic was technology so i thought of having my designing idea mixed with udemy.</p><br>
			<p>Udemy has navigation including sub-navigation but my websites have only navigations. But the desingning of my websites is simple and a decent background for writing blog.</p><br><br><br>

		<div class="defcompthree">
			<p>It's comparision between a movie website i.e. iflix and my conteact page. Login system for iflix are designed in a good manner but my contact page is about communicating with the developer and giving suggestions. Iflix Icon for social media are better then mine but atleast i can say that i have a suitable background for contact.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<div class="defcompfour">
			<p>Again, we have homapages of Amazone and my website home page. I think amazone home page have different features like search bar, order storing place but home page of amazone has too much of pictures and words and also too many ads.  In comparision i have my website clean and some quotes.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

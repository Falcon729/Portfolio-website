				<b>Introduction</b><br><p>Hi! Everyone I am Rupesh Khadka. I am from Nepal. My DOB is on 10 Dec 1999. I am very passionate about things that i am interested in and also always try to learn as many things as possible. I have an interest in football, playing esports games, jogging and also i like to make new friends. I would like taking risks and i am good at taking my own decisions that can take me one more step towards success.</p><br>
				<b>Education</b><p>Currently, i am studying BIT (Bachelor in Information Technology) at Itahari International College. But before that, i was at Nilkantha Sec. Eng. School from where i have passed my SLC (currently SEE). I got 59.13% at SLC. Then i moved to Viswa Adarsha College for my higher studies and completed my study with an aggregate percentage of 64.50. After my +2 examination, it was boring, so i started taking IELTS class and got 6.5. </p></desc> </div>
